My name is Jean-Fran√ßois Lalonde, and I am a software developer. I've been
working at [TextUs](www.textus.com) for over 3 years now, doing React (a little)
and Ruby on Rails (a lot).

Before working in the software industry, I worked at a microbrewery. I donned
many hats there, but my favorite was brewing beer. I still craft beer at home,
but now I craft code too!

### More Information

I live in Denver, CO with my wife Emily and our dog Brewski. I enjoy outdoorsy
things like skiing, mountain biking, hiking, and camping.
I stumbled into the world of software after hearing about
[Turing](https://turing.io/) and deciding to try my hand at coding. Turns out I like
it very much!
