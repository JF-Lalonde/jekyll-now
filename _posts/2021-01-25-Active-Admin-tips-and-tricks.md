I occasionally work in [ActiveAdmin](https://activeadmin.info/), a Rails admin
framework. I've found that it's great to get you up and running quickly, and
offers a lot of features out of the box for probably 80% of what admins on your
app would need.

That remaining 20% can be a doozy though. For all of its ease in setting up the
basics, attempting to get more complex functionality out of AA can be an uphill
battle. This is why I figured I would write about some of the discoveries I've
made along the way, so I can hopefully save some people from the headaches I've
gotten fighting with AA.
